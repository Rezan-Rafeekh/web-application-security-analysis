# Web Application Behavior & Security Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the behavior of a web application in a controlled environment to identify inconsistencies between expected and observed behavior that could introduce security risks.
The goal of this project is not exploitation, but understanding application logic, data flow, and access behavior from a security perspective.

## Scope
- User input handling
- Access flow and role-based behavior
- Application responses to unexpected or invalid inputs

## Methodology
- Reviewed expected application behavior based on interface and documentation
- Interacted with the application using normal and edge-case inputs
- Observed and recorded differences between expected and actual behavior
- Assessed potential impact and scope of identified observations

## Key Learnings
- Importance of validating assumptions about system behavior
- How small inconsistencies in input handling or access flow can lead to security issues
- Value of documenting scope and impact before escalation
- Gained a clearer understanding of how application behavior can differ from design assumptions.
- Learned to approach security issues by first defining scope and impact before technical details.
- Improved documentation skills by structuring observations clearly for review.


## Ethical Considerations
All analysis was performed in a controlled environment on intentionally vulnerable or local applications. No real-world systems were tested.
